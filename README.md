# Culture Insights: NLP & Sentiment Analysis
## Mining Employee Feedback for Organizational Health

### Overview
Analyzed 3,100+ employee comments and 50+ exit interviews using natural language 
processing to identify cultural themes, sentiment trends, and psychological safety 
issues driving retention.

### Business Problem
Organizations often don't know *why* employees leave. Exit reasons are scattered 
across documents and conversations. Systematically analyzing this text data reveals 
actionable patterns that drive retention decisions.

### Key Results
- **Comments Analyzed**: 3,100+
- **Sentiment Accuracy**: 87% (vs manual coding validation)
- **Topics Identified**: 10 distinct cultural themes
- **Primary Exit Reasons**: Leadership (59%), Workload (50%), Growth (35%)

### Key Finding
**Pay ranks 5th** (15% mention). **Leadership quality** (59%) and **workload 
management** (50%) are the dominant retention drivers. This is a culture problem, 
not a compensation problem.

### Data
- **Survey Comments**: 3,100+ employee comments (2024-2025)
- **Exit Interviews**: 50+ structured departures
- **Sentiment Labels**: Pre-labeled as Positive, Neutral, Negative
- Sample data provided in `data/` folder (anonymized)

### NLP Methods
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER (handles negation/punctuation) + TextBlob (context)
- **Consensus Approach**: Combined both methods for reliability (87% accuracy)
- **Topic Modeling**: TF-IDF vectorization + K-Means clustering
- **Custom Metrics**: Psychological safety keyword index
- **Validation**: Manual coding validation on sample of 100 comments

### Key Themes Discovered
1. **Leadership/Supervision** (59%): Feedback, development, visibility
2. **Workload/Burnout** (50%): Caseload, hours, sustainability
3. **Growth/Career** (35%): Development, advancement, opportunity
4. **Culture/Inclusion** (24%): Belonging, team dynamics, values
5. **Compensation** (15%): Pay, benefits (ranked 5th)

### Key Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Address supervision quality in high-turnover departments
2. **Short-term**: Implement supervisor training and workload review
3. **Long-term**: Create career development pathways

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+
